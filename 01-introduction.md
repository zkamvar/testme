:::::::::::::::: questions :::::::::::::::::::::

- HOW do you write a lesson using RMarkdown and `{sandpaper}`?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: objectives ::::::::::::::::::::

- Explain how to use markdown with the new lesson template
- Demonstrate how to include pieces of code, figures, and nested challenge blocks

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Introduction

This is the new Carpentries template. It is written in [RMarkdown][r-markdown],
which is a variant of Markdown that allows you to render code inside the
lesson. Please refer to the [lesson
example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three block quotes required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` These are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` These are the learning objectives for an episode
 3. `keypoints` These are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

No matter where these blocks appear, they will always be placed at the right
part of the html page.


:::::::::::::::: keypoints :::::::::::::::::::::

- Use `.Rmd` files for lessons even if you don't need to generate any code
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

This is an instructor aside, in the future, you should be able to hide this

::::::::::::::: challenge ::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?


```r
paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 


```{.output}
[1] "This new template looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Nest Solution
 
You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

# Figures

You can also include figures:


```r
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("powderblue", "lemonchiffon", "lavender"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

# Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?
